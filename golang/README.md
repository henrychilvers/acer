## Motivation
Our family likes to do Lego Advent Calendar (https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-Star-Wars-Advent-Calendar-75184), and there are 3 kids. So we've had to figure out how to fairly randomize
who gets to pick which door to open.

This is the Go port of my original Java 11 version of A.C.E.R.
