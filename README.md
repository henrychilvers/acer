## Motivation
Our family likes to do advent calendars like the Lego ones (https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-Star-Wars-Advent-Calendar-75184) or Funko Pop ones (https://www.funko.com/blog/article/coming-soon-advent-calendars). And since there are 3 kids, we've had to figure out how to fairly randomize who gets to pick which door to open. Enter A.C.E.R.

This is also an excercise in creating an application in multiple languages.

## Languages
- Java 11
- Kotlin
- Python
- Go Lang
- NodeJS (coming soon)
- React (coming soon)
